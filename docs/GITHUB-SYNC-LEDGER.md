- Focused ecosystem, Central Admin and NaijaDrive tests — 19 passed, 0 failed.
- Full ecosystem route coverage test — 4 passed, 0 failed.
- Local D1 migration `0085_pan_africa_rollout_controls.sql` — passed.
- Local country count — 54.

## Known gates not green

- Whole-repository `npm run test:node` has existing unrelated production waitlist and NestJS TypeScript source-loader failures.
- `npm run test:ts-baseline` reports existing NestJS decorator/runtime diagnostics; the Worker rollout implementation builds successfully.
- REA CLI/MCP shell verification remains blocked by the npm cache permissions issue; existing REA configuration and Evidence IDs were preserved.
