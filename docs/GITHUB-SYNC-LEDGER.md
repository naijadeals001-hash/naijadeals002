## Checkpoint contents

- Full ecosystem registry expansion.
- Public preview routes for reserved verticals.
- Pan-African country/vertical rollout migration.
- Protected Control Center rollout APIs.
- Country/vertical rollout controls on `/control-center/countries`.
- Central Admin and NaijaDrive safeguards from the preserved implementation batch.
- REA evidence and ecosystem coverage documentation.

## Batch A — NaijaGigs verification

- REA CLI: `rea@6.7.0`; MCP registration aligned in `/home/user/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc`.
- REA doctor: CLI/runtime healthy; reverse-engineering engines Hopper, Ghidra, IDA, JADX and Kuna unavailable on this Linux sandbox. Browser provider was available.
- REA reference evidence: Fiverr public workflow `ev_e63b7d0c6b4103bf9982a6735befd4d012b47fd64c54e5008055626c5474e17b`; observed public marketplace entry capture without authentication bypass.
- Additional accessible reference captures: Airbnb `ev_2a78b88f1f1b11331ab966058d64b5758719b70220303bc2cbcf6044417533fc`, Uber `ev_cd4d7ac8a16a7e171e6b6a58bf8913c480924ee91d37325d222af53d6a9ea337`, YouTube `ev_8f5b35a41117731d1fa55678a07ed071756966f4d59a8cd7967ed10e86b1e7b4`; DHL capture was unavailable and was not claimed as evidence.
- Preview routes: `/gigs`, `/gigs?q=plumber&city=Abuja` returned 200 through the existing PM2 preview.
- Browser: desktop `1440x900` and mobile `390x844`; screenshots `qa-screenshots/gigs-desktop.png` and `qa-screenshots/gigs-mobile.png`.
- Browser interactions: search form changed URL and filtered real Service Engine listings; no console/page errors or failed requests.
- Lifecycle regression: `tests/naijagigs-lifecycle.e2e.mjs` — 1 passed, 0 failed.
- Known limitation: no matching local listing for the test term `plumber`, so the filtered result correctly showed the empty state rather than fabricated data.

## Verification before push

- `npm run build` — passed.
- Focused ecosystem, Central Admin and NaijaDrive tests — 19 passed, 0 failed.
- Full ecosystem route coverage test — 4 passed, 0 failed.
- Local D1 migration `0085_pan_africa_rollout_controls.sql` — passed.
- Local country count — 54.
- Local ecosystem capability count — 20.
- Existing preview route smoke tests — passed.
- Browser Control Center verification — 54 country rows, 20 vertical options, rollout controls visible, authenticated rollout API returned 200.
- Unauthenticated rollout API returned 401.

## Known gates not green

- Whole-repository `npm run test:node` has existing unrelated production waitlist and NestJS TypeScript source-loader failures.
- `npm run test:ts-baseline` reports existing NestJS decorator/runtime diagnostics; the Worker rollout implementation builds successfully.
- REA analysis engines Hopper, Ghidra, IDA, JADX and Kuna remain unavailable; public browser research continued through the available Playwright provider.
- The worktree contains the locally generated untracked `.npm-cache-rea/` directory; it was intentionally excluded from the Batch A commit.
